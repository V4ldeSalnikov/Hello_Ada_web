Project Overview

This is a web-based game developed using Flask and JavaScript, with NLP and spell correction for processing text commands. The player controls a character by entering commands via text or voice, and the game supports both English and Danish commands. Commands include actions like moving the character left, right, jumping, and changing the color of the character. The game integrates external libraries such as spaCy, TextBlob, and SpellChecker for NLP processing, typo correction, and language detection.
